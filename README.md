## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jae. I'm majoring in Computer Science, with a focus on graphics, vision problems, and machine learning.

- I worked as a TD in the VFX and animation industry for about five years.
- I am seeking a research opportunity to pursue a master's degree, with the possibility of continuing to a PhD, starting in Spring or Fall 2026.

My research interest is 
- Generative models
- 3d vision
- also, widely interested in specific applications of ML/DL for visual art (images and videos)
