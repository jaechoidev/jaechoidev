## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jae. I'm currently studying Computer Science, focusing on graphics and vision problems.

- I worked as TD in the VFX and animation industry for about five years.
- I'm seeking a research opportunity to pursue a master's degree in 2025 Fall or 2026 Spring.

My research interest is 
- computational photography: relighting, scene understanding - mostly ML/DL for VFX
- artwork generation such as style transfer, neural methods for painting, drawing, music, etc.
- widely interested in specific applications of ML/DL for visual art.
